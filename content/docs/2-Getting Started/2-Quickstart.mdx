## Hello ðŸ”¥ API

### Code

The best way to start getting familiarised with <FlamaName /> is by example.
Let's start coding the simplest application:

```python
from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}
```

The code does the following:

- Imports <FlamaName /> and creates the instance `app` of this class.
- Adds the `route()` decorator to the user-defined function `home`. This decorator
  specifies that the function `home` will be called when a request to the route `/` is made.
  This will return the dictionary `{"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}`.
  [ comment ] - Defines the host URL (`http://0.0.0.0`) and port (`8080`) where the `app` will be served.

You can download this code in your `examples` folder by running:

```commandline
> cd examples
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perdy/flama/master/examples/hello_flama.py
```

### Flama run

To run your first <FlamaName /> application:

```commandline
> export FLAMA_APP=examples.hello_flama:app
> flama run

INFO:     Started server process [78260]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This command runs the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) web server.
If you click now on [`http://127.0.0.0:8000`](http://127.0.0.0:8000), you should see
the greeting message `{"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}` on your browser.

#### Alternative running

The previous code can be tuned a bit so that you can run it the same way from
your favourite programming IDE:

```python
import uvicorn
from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return {"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
```

You can now run the code directly from your IDE, either by clicking on the
run button, or by any other key shortcut you prefer, and you will obtain the
same result. As of now, we will always include this small modification in our
examples, but will always use <FlamaName /> CLI to run the examples to showcase
the conveniences it brings.

#### What if the server does not start?

There are several reasons why the server might not start after running `flama run`.

If there is another service already using the port `8000` you will see an
error like:

```commandline
> flama run examples.hello_flama:app

INFO:     Started server process [54203]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
ERROR:    [Errno 48] error while attempting to bind on address ('127.0.0.1', 8000):
          address already in use
INFO:     Waiting for application shutdown.
INFO:     Application shutdown complete.
```

If you get an error similar to:

```commandline
> flama run examples.hello_flama:app

command not found: flama
```

this means the virtual environment where <FlamaName /> was installed is not active.
Activate the virtual environment (see [installation](/docs/getting-started/installation))
and try again.

Another possibility is that the application path (i.e. `examples.hello_flama:app`)
is wrong. This is the case when you have an error like:

```commandline
> flama run hello_flama:app
ERROR:    Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "hello_flama".
```

The only way of fixing this is by providing `flama run` the correct application
path. In this example, the path must be `examples.hello_flama:app` given that we
are running <FlamaName /> CLI at the same level as the folder `examples`:

```commandline
examples/
â””â”€â”€ hello_flama.py
    â””â”€â”€ app
```

### Autogenerated API docs

Don't you miss anything in our previous code? Sure, docstrings!
We know, we know, they are very important.
Let's add it:

```python
from flama import Flama

import uvicorn

app = Flama(
    title="Hello-ðŸ”¥",
    version="1.0",
    description="My first API",
)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    """
    tags:
        - Salute
    summary:
        Returns a warming message.
    description:
        This is a more detailed description of the method itself.
        Here we can give all the details required and they will appear
        automatically in the auto-generated docs.
    responses:
        200:
            description: Warming hello message.
    """
    return {"message": "Hello ðŸ”¥"}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

We can know proceed, and run:

```commandline
> flama run

INFO:     Started server process [3267]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This time, let's visit [`http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
and see what's there waiting for us.
