<FlamaName /> is a python library which establishes a standard framework for
development and deployment of APIs with special focus on machine learning (ML).
The main aim of the framework is to make ridiculously simple the deployment of
ML APIs, simplifying (when possible) the entire process to a single line of
code.

The library builds on Starlette, and provides an easy-to-learn
philosophy to speed up the building of highly performant GraphQL, REST and ML APIs.
Besides, it comprises an ideal solution for the development of asynchronous
and production-ready services, offering automatic deployment for ML models.

Some remarkable characteristics:

    - Generic classes for API resources with the convenience of standard CRUD methods
          over SQLAlchemy tables.

    - A schema system (based on Marshmallow or Typesystem) which allows the
          declaration of inputs and outputs of endpoints very easily, with the convenience of
          reliable and automatic data-type validation.

    - Dependency injection to make ease the process of managing parameters needed
          in endpoints via the use of `Component`s.
          Flama ASGI objects like `Request`, `Response`, `Session` and so on
          are defined as `Component`s ready to be injected in your endpoints.

    - `Component`s as the base of the plugin ecosystem, allowing you to create
          custom or use those already defined in your endpoints, injected as parameters.

    - Auto generated API schema using OpenAPI standard.

    - Auto generated `docs`, and provides a Swagger UI and ReDoc endpoints.

    - Automatic handling of pagination, with several methods at your disposal
          such as `limit`, `offset`, page numbers, to name a few.

Now that you know all the pros
