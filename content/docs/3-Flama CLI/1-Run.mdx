## Running an App

### Introducting Flama CLI

We have already seen how to use the command line to run an **app** in the
[Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart), but we didn't do a proper introduction of the command line interface
(CLI). <FlamaName /> CLI is a convenient tool which is installed automatically with the package, and reduces the hurdles
of serving your app.

Once you have a developed app that you want to serve, you need to choose and configure a web server, e.g. [gunicorn]()
or [uvicorn](), and that eventually becomes a repetitive task.

<FlamaName /> CLI precisely aims at reducing the effort invested in this step to the bare minimum, so that you can focus
on developing your app.

### Parameters

#### App path

To be able to serve an app, you need to have a file where you have the following lines:

```python
from flama import Flama

app = Flama()

...
```

As we did in the [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart), let's assume that the file containing these lines is
**main.py**, which is located at:

```commandLine
project_folder/
└── src
    └── main.py
        └── app
```

For <FlamaName /> to be able to run the app, it needs to know the exact path to the **app** variable. The path can be
passed directly to the CLI as argument, or by utilising the equivalent environment variable **FLAMA_APP**. Thus, if we
are at **project_folder** (following the previous example of folder structure), we can run the app by either of the
following two ways:

##### Using option argument

```commandLine
> flama run src.main:app

INFO:     Started server process [3267]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

##### Using environment variable

```commandLine
> export FLAMA_APP=src.main:app
> flama run

INFO:     Started server process [3267]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

#### Development mode

If you run your app as specified above, everything will be running with the code as it was at the moment you run the
command. However, more often than not, you might need to make some changes in the code of your app, which would require
you to stop and rerun it again for the changes to take effect. In such scenario, you might be interested in running the
app in **development mode**. When running in development mode, the webserver will autodetect changes in the underlying
code, and will reload the app automatically for you.

For this, we only need to run one of the following two options:

##### Using option argument

```commandLine
> flama run --dev
```

##### Using environment variable

```commandLine
> export FLAMA_DEV=True
> flama run
```

The convenience of this mode of execution does not stop here. Running in development mode also brings useful tools which
make the debugging of the code easier, e.g. highly-detailed error messages, and interactive error webpages.

#### Further options

<FlamaName /> CLI uses **uvicorn** as webserver, and it is because of this that it accepts every argument of the uvicorn
CLI. For the exhaustive list of arguments you can pass, and their usage, we recommend you to check
