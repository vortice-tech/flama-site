## Start with definition files

At this point, you've probably already learned how to quickly serve **flama** applications, and ML models codeless, with
the [run](/docs/flama-cli/run) and [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve) methods, respectively. But that's not the end of the
story. Indeed, we could say the fun part is just about to start.

<FlamaName /> CLI comes with the very convenient command **start**, which builds on top of what we have already seen,
and take it to the next level. The **run** command is thought for a highly customised way of serving apps and/or models
by specifying their details and characteristics in *definition files*, which allows us to have all the specs related
with the deployment as code. Definition files may be control versioned, which makes the deployment process reproducible
and resilient.

A <FlamaName/> definition file consists of a set of blueprints which _explains_ how to build a custom application. This
file includes the specifics of the base <FlamaName/> application we build on, routes regarding where the documentation
and schemas will be served, besides the models we wan to add from our local system.

As always, the command **flama run** also comes with help:

```commandline
> flama run --help

Usage: flama start [OPTIONS] [FLAMA_CONFIG]

  Start a Flama Application based on a config file.

Options:
  --create-config  Create minimal config file.
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```

### Your first definition file

The best way to start with definition files is by example. For this purpose, you can simply run:

```commandline
> flama run --create-config
```

This command line will produce a simple definition file which will be stored in your current folder as `flama.json`.
Let's dig into it a bit:

```commandline
> cat flama.json

{
    "dev": false,
    "app": {
        "title": "API title",
        "version": "0.1.0",
        "description": "API description",
        "schema": "/schema/",
        "docs": "/docs/",
        "models": [{"url": "/model-url/", "path": "model-path.flm", "name": "model-name"}],
    },
}
```

### Sections

As you can readily check, the definition file consists of a set of sections which define our application. The first
section we find is **"dev"**, is a boolean option that will make the app run under development mode or not (which quite
convenient whilst developing). By default it comes as **False**, i.e. not active. The second section is **"app"**, which
encapsulates all the options defining an application, including the models and routes that can be served in it.
