## Start with definition files

At this point, you've probably already learned how to quickly serve **flama** applications, and ML models codeless, with
the [run](/docs/flama-cli/run) and [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve) methods, respectively. But that's not the end of the
story. Indeed, we could say the fun part is just about to start.

<FlamaName /> CLI comes with the very convenient command **start**, which builds on top of what we have already seen,
and take it to the next level. The **run** command is thought for a highly customised way of serving apps and/or models
by specifying their details and characteristics in *definition files*, which allows us to have all the specs related
with the deployment as code. Definition files may be control versioned, which makes the deployment process reproducible
and resilient.

A <FlamaName/> definition file consists of a set of blueprints which _explains_ how to build a custom application. This
file includes the specifics of the base <FlamaName/> application we build on, routes regarding where the documentation
and schemas will be served, besides the models we wan to add from our local system.

As always, the command **flama run** also comes with help:

```commandline
> flama start --help

Usage: flama start [OPTIONS] [FLAMA_CONFIG]

  Start a Flama Application based on a config file.

Options:
  --create-config  Create minimal config file.
  --help           Show this message and exit.
```

### Your first definition file

The best way to start with definition files is by example. For this purpose, you can simply run:

```commandline
> flama start --create-config
```

This command line will produce a simple definition file which will be stored in your current folder as `flama.json`.
Let's dig into it a bit:

```commandline
> cat flama.json

{
    "dev": false,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 8000,
    "app": {
        "title": "API title",
        "version": "0.1.0",
        "description": "API description",
        "schema": "/schema/",
        "docs": "/docs/",
        "models": [{"url": "/model-url/", "path": "model-path.flm", "name": "model-name"}],
    },
}
```

### Sections

As you can readily check, the definition file consists of a set of sections which define our application. The first
section we find is **"dev"**, this is a boolean option that will make the app run under development mode or not (which
quite convenient whilst developing). By default, this option comes as **False**, i.e. not active. The second section you
will find is **"app"**, which encapsulates all the options defining an application, including the models and routes that
can be served in it. In particular, we find the following fields, which we can populate according to our needs:

- **Title**: This is the name of the app which will be serving the ML models (e.g., "ML API"). This is the same as the
  parameter `--app-title` of [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve)
- **Version**: Version of the application (e.g., "0.1.0"). This is the same as the parameter `--app-version` of
  [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve)
- **Description**: Description of the application (e.g., "API serving several models"). This is the same as the
  parameter `--app-description` of [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve)
- **Schema**: Route where the API schema will be served (e.g., **/schema/**).
- **Docs**: Route where the API documentation website will be served (e.g., **/docs/**)
- **Models**: This represents a list of models that will be served via our API. Each model will be represented by the
  parameters **url** (e.g., "/model-url/"), **path** (e.g., "model-path.flm"), and **name** (e.g., "model-name").

We can refer to this way of specifying the app properties as **import dictionary**. But, there is still another way of
populating the "app" section of the definition file with a single line, which is the **import string**. Indeed, we have
already used the import strings when we introduced the command [run](/docs/flama-cli/run), the import string was the
path to the app object expressed in the format **module:attribute** (e.g. **src.main:app**).

## Examples

### Serving a Flama App

The easiest way of using definition files is by populating the app field via import string. Let's try the following
definition:

```json
{
  "dev": false,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8000,
  "app": "examples.hello_flama:app"
}
```

Now, we can run the following command (assuming your definition file is named **flama.json**):

```commandline
> flama start flama.json

INFO:     Started server process [96911]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Serving a single model

Let us start with the simplest example, which is using a definition file which only includes a single ML model:

```json
{
  "dev": false,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8000,
  "app": {
    "title": "Scikit Learn Model API",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "This API is serving a scikit-learn classifier",
    "schema": "/schema/",
    "docs": "/docs/",
    "models": [{ "url": "/sklearn/", "path": "sklearn_model.flm", "name": "sklearn-classifier" }]
  }
}
```

We only have to run the following command to get it running (assuming your definition file is named **flama.json**):

```commandline
> flama start flama.json

INFO:     Started server process [94140]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Serving several models

Now, we can take <FlamaName/> CLI to its maximum potential by specifying how to serve multiple models, and other
configuration parameters of the app, in a single definition file. Let's try the following example:

```json
{
  "dev": false,
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8000,
  "app": {
    "title": "Multi ML Model API",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "This API is serving multiple machine-learning models codeless",
    "schema": "/schema/",
    "docs": "/docs/",
    "models": [
      { "url": "/sklearn/", "path": "sklearn_model.flm", "name": "sklearn-classifier" },
      { "url": "/pytorch/", "path": "pytorch_model.flm", "name": "pytorch-regressor" },
      { "url": "/tensorflow/", "path": "tensorflow_model.flm", "name": "tf-regressor" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Now, we can run the following command (assuming your definition file is named **flama.json**):

```commandline
> flama start flama.json

INFO:     Started server process [96911]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
