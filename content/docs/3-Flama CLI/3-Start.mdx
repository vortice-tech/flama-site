## Start with a definition file

For a highly customised way of serving models, which offers much finer details about the models to serve and their
characteristics, <FlamaName /> introduces the concept of definition files. A definition file allows you to have all the
specs related with the deployment of an ML API as code. Definition files may be control versioned, which make the
deployment process reproducible and resilient.

- Examples with different definition files from simpler to more complicated versions
- Example for a standard Flama API (talk about all flags we discussed in Run)
