## Start with definition files

At this point, you've probably already learned how to quickly serve **flama** applications, and ML models codeless, with
[run](/docs/flama-cli/run) and [serve](/docs/flama-cli/serve), respectively. But that's not the end of the story.
Indeed, we could say the fun part is just about to start.

<FlamaName /> CLI comes with the very convenient command **start**, which builds on top of what we have already seen,
and take it a step forward. The **run** command is thought for a highly customised way of serving apps and/or models by
specifying their details and characteristics in *definition files*. A definition file

Definition files allows us to have all the specs related with the deployment of an App, or an ML API, as code.

Definition files may be control versioned, which make the deployment process reproducible and resilient.

We will introduce here:

- The structure of a definition file
- Examples with different definition files from simpler to more complicated versions
- Example for a standard Flama API (talk about all flags we discussed in Run)
- Examples for a ML Flama API
