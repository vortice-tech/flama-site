In the previous section we covered the fundamentals of building custom model resources. Understanding
what model resources are, and how to use them, was the first step in building a custom model. We took
advantage of the <FlamaName /> built-in's **ModelResource** and **ModelResourceType** to create a custom
model resource that incorporated custom methods and exposed them as routes of our API,
beyond the standard **/predict/** and **/inspect/** routes added by default when using <FlamaName /> CLI,
or the syntax **app.models.add_model** (see the sections about [adding models](/docs/machine-learning-api/add-models#add-models) and
[adding model resources](/docs/machine-learning-api/model-resource#adding-the-resource) for more details).

```python
class CustomModel(Model):
    def inspect(self) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.__dict__

    def predict(self, x: typing.Any) -> typing.Any:
        return self.model.predict(x)


class CustomModelComponent(ModelComponent):
    def resolve(self) -> CustomModel:
        return self.model


component = CustomModelComponent(model)


class CustomModelResource(ModelResource, metaclass=ModelResourceType):
    name = "custom_model"
    verbose_name = "Custom model"
    component = component


app.add_component(component)
app.models.add_model_resource("/", CustomModelResource)
```
